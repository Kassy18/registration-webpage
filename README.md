DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:
This project is an interactive registration page that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate theme switching, form validation, and event handling. It allows users to toggle between light and dark modes, validates form inputs in real-time, and provides feedback messages for errors or successful registration.Real-time validation is also implemented to give instant feedback as the user types, and a success message is displayed once the form is correctly filled out. The project also showcases event bubbling and capturing through a nested div and button example, helping learners understand how events propagate in the DOM.
